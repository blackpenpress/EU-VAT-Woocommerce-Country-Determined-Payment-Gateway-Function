# EU-VAT-Woocommerce-Country-Determined-Payment-Gateway-Function
Function for woocommerce to set the payment gateway based on the billing address country.
So a service like paddle.com which handles VAT can be used for EU countries and a cheaper 
gateway can be used everywhere else.

No guarantee and check that this method is legal in your country
